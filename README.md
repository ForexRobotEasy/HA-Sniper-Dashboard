This code is a sample implementation of the HA Sniper Dashboard, a tool developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It utilizes the HikenAshi indicator and provides real-time alerts for currency pairs that are experiencing significant market movements.

## How it Works:

### Initialization:
1. The necessary libraries and functions are included.
2. Constants are defined, including the number of symbols to subscribe to and the alert threshold.
3. Global variables are declared, including a flag to indicate if the dashboard has been initialized, an instance of the CTrade class for trade functions, and an instance of the CHikenAshi class for the HikenAshi indicator.

### OnInit():
1. The HikenAshi indicator is created.
2. The trade functions are initialized. If initialization fails, an error message is printed.
3. The necessary symbols are subscribed to using the trade.SymbolSelect() function.

### OnTick():
1. The function checks if the dashboard has been initialized. If not, it returns.
2. It loops through each currency pair.
3. The HikenAshi values (open and close) are calculated for each currency pair.
4. The market dynamics are calculated by subtracting the open value from the close value.
5. If the market is moving (absolute change in market dynamics is greater than the alert threshold), a real-time alert is sent using the trade.Alert() function.

### OnAlert():
1. This function is triggered when an alert is received.
2. It displays the alert message on the dashboard.

### OnDeinit():
1. This function is triggered when the dashboard is being deinitialized.
2. It closes any open trades using the trade.CloseAll() function.
